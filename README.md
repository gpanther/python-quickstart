# Python Quickstart

Premise: you know programming but know no (or only a little of) Python.

**Note**: This is for Python 3, *NOT* legacy Python (2.7)

## Introduction

- Python: a slow, statically typed (but checked at runtime) scripting language.
- Sorry for choosing it, here are some steps to make it less painful

## Virtual environments, packages

```bash

```

## Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dicts, sets

## Ordered dicts, frozensets, named touple, counter

## Testing, TDD, mocking

## Function, decorators

* Closures

## Classes

* Inheritance
* Magic methods

## Generators

## Itertools and more itertools

## Static analyzers, coverage

## Debugging

## WSGI, Flask
